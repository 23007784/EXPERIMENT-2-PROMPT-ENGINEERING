# EXP-2-PROMPT-ENGINEERING-

## Aim: 
Comparative Analysis of different types of Prompting patterns and explain with Various Test Scenarios

Experiment:
Test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios. 
Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.


## Algorithm:
1. Prepare two sets of prompts
2. Apply both prompt types across multiple scenarios
3. Record outputs generated by the model for each prompt–scenario pair
4. Analyze & Compare
## OUTPUT
## Basic prompt:
Tell me about trees.

## Output:

Trees in Nature (Biology & Environment)

Definition: Trees are tall, perennial plants with a single main stem (the trunk) that supports branches and leaves.

Parts of a Tree:

Roots: Anchor the tree and absorb water/nutrients.

Trunk: Supports the tree, transports water (xylem) and food (phloem).

Branches & Leaves: Capture sunlight for photosynthesis.

Flowers & Fruits: Help in reproduction.

Importance:

Produce oxygen 

Absorb carbon dioxide (reduce global warming)

Provide shade, shelter, food, timber, medicine

Support biodiversity (birds, insects, animals live in them)

Trees in Computer Science (Data Structures)

Definition: A tree is a hierarchical data structure that organizes elements (called nodes).

Structure:

Root: The top node.

Branches (Edges): Connections between nodes.

Leaves: Nodes without children.

Types: Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, B-Tree, etc.

Applications:

Organizing files in a computer.

Database indexing.

Decision-making (decision trees).

AI search algorithms.

## Elaborate Prompt:
Help me to know about the trees in the forest and how they are benificial for us in bullet point and give 10 points about it with easy understanding english.

## Output:

Trees in the Forest – Benefits to Us

1. Give Oxygen – Trees produce the oxygen we breathe through photosynthesis.
2. Clean the Air – They absorb dust, smoke, and harmful gases, making the air fresher.
3. Cool the Climate – Forests reduce heat by providing shade and lowering temperatures.
4. Home for Animals – Birds, insects, and wildlife live in trees, keeping nature balanced.
5. Prevent Soil Erosion – Roots hold the soil together and stop it from being washed away by rain.
6. Give Us Food – Fruits, nuts, and leaves from trees are part of our diet.
7. Provide Medicine – Many medicines come from tree bark, leaves, or roots.
8. Source of Wood – Timber is used for furniture, houses, and tools.
9. Bring Rain – Trees release water vapor into the air, which helps form clouds and rain.
10. Make Us Healthy & Happy – Spending time around trees reduces stress and improves mental health.

## Result
The experiment showed that refined prompts produced more accurate, clear, and detailed responses compared to broad or unstructured prompts. Broad prompts often led to vague or less focused outputs. Overall, prompt clarity directly improved the quality, accuracy, and depth of model responses.
